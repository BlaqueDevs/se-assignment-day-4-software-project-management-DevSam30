# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
  Timely delivery is crucial as it helps maintain cleint satisfaction, build trust, and avoid potential penalties relating to delays. To ensure deadlines are met, project managers can ensure proper and accurate project planning is done to properly estimate timelines, and set up efective communication timelines between team members and stakeholders to identify issues early.
  
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
  Effective cost control allows the team to ensure project expenses stay within the allocated budget and that there are no budget overruns. To prevent budget overruns, accurate cost estimation and budget planning should be done at the onset of the project. Re-use of components amd modules where possible can also help in reducing development time and costs.
  
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
  Waterfall and agile methodologies defer in that waterfall is linear and uses distinct phases whereas agile is iterative and emphasizes flexibility. Both can be used to oversee the successful development of a software solution. Advantages of waterfall methodology are that is uses a clear structure and determines the end goal early. However, it makes changes difficult and excludes the end user. Advantages of agile methodology are that it wncourages stakeholder collaboration and helps deliver high quality software. However, Agile methodology may cause unpredictability and increases planning and coordination overhead.
  
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
  Waterfall is best used in scenarios where requirements are fully known beforehand and are not expected to change, for example, an electronic medical system,  whereas agile is best suited for scenarios where the requirements may change and flexibilty and agility is pivotal to the completion of the project, for example, a social media platform.
  
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
  To ensure quality assurance, methods such as testing and reviews can be used. The different types of testing such as unit, functional, and acceptance testing can be used to rid the software of errors and bugs. Code reviews can also be done by team members to check for errors and security vulnerabilities. Maintaining high standards is crucial to ensure the final product meet the end-users' requirements while keeping delays to a minimum.
  
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
  A well defined project scope provides a clear roadmap for the project and sets expectations on what needs to be delivered. Clear project boundaries lead to better planning and execution. A WBS is a visual, hierarchical and deliverable-oriented deconstruction of a project which allows project managers to break down project scope and visualize tasks.
  
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
  A detailed project schedule helps ensure a project is completed on time and wihtin budget. A Gantt chart can assist in creating a project schedule as it gives a visual of how long each task should take, while highlighting how tasks overlap thus allowing the team to properly plan to execute the schedule.
  
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
  The core issue addressed is the lack of affordable healthcare, aiming to tackle SDG 3 - Good health and well-being. Good healthcare is unavailable and not affordable to a majority of the population making them vulnerable to various illnesses and diseases.
  
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
  A clear definition of the problem will help in determining the requirements, defining the scope, and budget planning, which are crucial in the development of a software solution that is of high quality and that addresses the problem sufficiently.
  
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
  The software solution is a telemedicine solution, allowing patients in low income areas to access medical attention through partnerships that will be made within the medical industry.
  
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
  - An AI agent that can attend to some cases to assist doctors manage patient load.
  - The ability of patient to have face to face virtual meetings with medical professionals.
    
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
  Twaweza Kenya's report indicates that nearly half of Kenyans lack resources to seek medical care, with 47% lacking any form of health insurance. This indicates that a telemedicine solution has the potential to grow as many Kenyans would utilize its free or affordable services.
  
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
  Understanding market trends allows a team to figure out when it is the best time to deploy the solution to have maximum reach and to identify the most important features to include in the solution.
